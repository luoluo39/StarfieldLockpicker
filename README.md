# Starfield Lockpicker

A simple tool that automaticly unlock locks in Starfield
### Usage:
1. Start game and this tool with any order
2. Enter the unlock in game
3. WAIT UNTIL END OF UI ANIMATION
4. MOVE MOUSE CURSOR AWAY FROM ANY UI ELEMENT
5. Press F10

## For multi-monitor users:
In config, change display to the monitor id where your game is.

## Notice:
Programs running with administrator privileges will block hotkeys being registered by software running without administrator privileges. So, if this situation occurs, this tool will not function properly.
Therefore, unless necessary, try to avoid running games (or any untrusted software) with administrator privileges!
You can of course run this tool with administrator privileges to bypass this issue, but only do so if you trust this and think it necessary.

runtime-required means you need to install Microsoft's .net7 runtime to run, which is not pre-installed in operation system.
independent version contain a sliced runtime inside, so you don't need to install runtime but it comes with significantly larger size.
