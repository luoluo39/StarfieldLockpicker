# Starfield Lockpicker

A simple tool that automaticly unlock locks in Starfield
### Usage:
1. Start game and this tool with any order
2. Enter the unlock in game
3. WAIT UNTIL END OF UI ANIMATION
4. MOVE MOUSE CURSOR AWAY FROM ANY UI ELEMENT
5. Press F10

## IMPORTANT FOR VERSION 0.2:
Config modify is normally not needed
modified config for 0.1 may not work because we will now adjust positions automaticly base on resolution.
also, you no longer need to input the key count manually, just push F10 and let it do its job.
### It seems unlikely to happen, but still technically possible: 
the new detect method will output wrong result if the key shapes periodicity repeats(for example, ABCDABCD),
if you encounter that, jus manually rotate any key to break this.
